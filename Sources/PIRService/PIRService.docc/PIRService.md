### Live Caller ID Lookup

[Live Caller ID
Lookup](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sms_and_call_reporting/getting_up-to-date_calling_and_blocking_information_for_your_app)
is a new feature in iOS 18.0 that allows the system to communicate with a third party service to privately retrieve information
about a phone number for an incoming call. This allows the system to automatically block known spam callers and display
identity information on the incoming call screen.
